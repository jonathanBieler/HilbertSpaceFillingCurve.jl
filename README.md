## Usage

Convert the linear index `d` into ndims-dimensional coordinates `p` :

`p = hilbert(d::T, ndims, nbits = 32) where T <: Integer`

Convert the ndims-dimensional coordinates `p` into the linear index `d` :

`d = hilbert(p::Vector{T}, ndims, nbits = 32) where T <: Integer`

All coordinates are positive integers (zero included). The number of bits `nbits` determines the precision of the curve, and the algorithm work under the constrain:

- `ndims * nbits <= 64`
